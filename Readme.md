## Data and code for the FK21 OTKA 138188 "Experimental study of morphological convergence in Hungarian"

The webcorpus2 frequency list is not hosted in this repository, sorry. I'll figure something out. 

### Workflow

- SRC: variable pattern pairs from webcorpus2 frequency list
- STIMULI: nonce words based on patterns
- EXP: pavlovia experiments
	- BASELINE: baseline rating task for nonce forms
	- ESP: matching task for nonce forms
- MODELS: modelling with gcm, mgl, ndl, and various other three letter acronyms I'm not even aware of yet
