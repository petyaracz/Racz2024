word lists: filter for intrasimilarity first, then filter for extrasimilarity
word lists: we're gonna have lists of 48 (since %% 3 == 0 and we have three suffixes for nouns and ep verbs)

made up some onsets for the verbs. there weren't enough verbs.

baseline exp: only keyboard control
all player lists compiled of everything and not even in blocks!

## 5-3-22

to do
psychopy script (see 4-3-22)
update real word roster w/ -unk/-ünk
filter nonce words, eventually

## 4-3-22

fixed: cc cvc pairs should have consonant alternation
new set of suffixes for ep verbs:
[/V][Prs.NDef.1Pl] cselekszünk/cselekedünk
[/V][Prs.NDef.3Pl] cselekszenek/cselekednek
[/V][Prs.NDef.2Pl] cselekedtek/cselekszetek

built psychopy script (github/pavlovia/baseline_demo)
it now does what I want. but at what cost. (cue PIL: Theme)
random list selection
random button order
records buttons and responses
random participant id????!!!
need to test it with pen and paper
need to see if mouse / keyboard setup works at all
need to add button press to experiment

## 3-3-22

rewrote everything, new round, ideas on words:
nouns

no empty coda for nouns!
no "-c" (gópec etc) coda

verbs
watch out for linking vowel in -dzik 
consonant match for szik zik? (gzik, kszik)
valami nem stimmel a kibaszott kurva distance fuggvennyel, tele van egy dist-ra levo szavakkal ez a fos
maybe drop szik/dik?

## 2-3-22

consulted with Rebrus. drafted filters on whole words, sequences.
rewrote filters. now word-level restrictions are done on corpus lists, and then constituents are filtered separately, and then holistic filters on combinations
big changes for verbs:
only working with CCik verbs now. specifically, -dik -szik -lik -zik verbs. this is because verb class is closed in hungarian, need to sell my nonce verbs are real on some level. plömplömözik sounds more real than plömplömik.
rewriting readme today, it's pretty outdated and I can't remember my code logic already!

## 22-2-22

to do: check new word set in gsheet.
prelim ideas:
only coc/cöc/cec, no cuc/cüc
simpler onsets! timike mondta

...this has been done & words filtered

## 21-2-2022

put filtering to very very end, before gcm. done. to do: gcm

## 19-2-2022

moving new code into build_nonce_word_lists.
to do:
- talk to people
- add gcm to code. it's missing now.

here we are
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Iximhc57X1yYPwtm10ubvYfNaT7YL7jje5RkOilUAPw/edit?usp=sharing

ideas for verbs:
different var for 2sg plural form / 3sg
no mixed voicing consonants in stem! maybe too serious. or at least not w/ sibilants? or not adjacent?
no mixed front harmony stems? some keep slipping through filter.

alternatively alternatively:
build ep verbs from ep stems ONLY (not many of these) (maybe add custom onsets)
-- not by stiching together ik verb stems and ep verb endings into bizarre frankenstein monsters (note that eszek/eszem verbs look miles less laughable currently)


## 15-2-2022

new approach.

build forms directly from real forms (not a generalised grammar).
developed in musings_1 and musings_2.
a LOT simpler but needs some more filtering. but that's where we were, so you know

## 15-2-2022

Rebrus comments
long V + cc only when V=á/é
*gb
*ccc
*lm
*lp
*écc#
*gv
ep verbs:
kalapszik/kalapozik or baszakszik/baszakodik
1: watch for vowels in "stem"
2: second vowel in "stem" can't be ö
1syl+szik nope (a few exceptions only)
no ö in v2 (front labial harmony thing)


## 14-2-2022

sample_nonce_stems finished, need to check otka szavak google sheet by hand

## 13-2-2022

got to sample_nonce_stems, but need to check it again. 
wrote an absolute amount of comment for files.
Readme toc up to date. text needs updating.

## 13-2-2022

stare at nonce words in google sheet, then
sample nonce words.
remember, 50 per list!
nouns: front/back, also e/é, also what kind of first vowel, maybe something with consonant cluster?
verbs: front/back,nsyl
or just do gcm already?

so it will be

stems -> words -> filter -> gcm -> sample -> forms!

do gcm on stems, but first
- change vowels in noun stems
- change consonants in ep stems (last c turns into c1 from random sample!)

## 12-2-2022

overhaul done with

stems -> words -> filter

- for nsyl==1 filtering is too strict
- initial overlap doesn't work (too well) so dropped it

next step: generating forms. some hand-filtering?

## 11-2-2022

overhaul of current to proposed design:

current design:

stems -> words -> filter (against real words, against each other) -> forms

proposed design:

stems -> filter (against real words, against each other) -> words -> forms

stems have been generated. now comes stem filtering, then form generation from filtered stems. then something!?
