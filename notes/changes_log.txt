got to sample_nonce_stems, but need to check it again. 
wrote an absolute amount of comment for files.
Readme toc up to date. text needs updating.

stare at nonce words in google sheet, then
sample nonce words.
remember, 50 per list!
nouns: front/back, also e/Ã©, also what kind of first vowel, maybe something with consonant cluster?
verbs: front/back,nsyl
or just do gcm already?

so it will be

stems -> words -> filter -> gcm -> sample -> forms!

do gcm on stems, but first
- change vowels in noun stems
- change consonants in ep stems (last c turns into c1 from random sample!)

overhaul done with

stems -> words -> filter

- for nsyl==1 filtering is too strict
- initial overlap doesn't work (too well) so dropped it

next step: generating forms. some hand-filtering?

overhaul of current to proposed design:

current design:

stems -> words -> filter (against real words, against each other) -> forms

proposed design:

stems -> filter (against real words, against each other) -> words -> forms

stems have been generated. now comes stem filtering, then form generation from filtered stems. then something!?
