moving new code into build_nonce_word_lists

## 15-2-2022

new approach.

build forms directly from real forms (not a generalised grammar).
developed in musings_1 and musings_2.
a LOT simpler but needs some more filtering. but that's where we were, so you know

Rebrus comments
long V + cc only when V=á/é
*gb
*ccc
*lm
*lp
*écc#
*gv
ep verbs:
kalapszik/kalapozik or baszakszik/baszakodik
1: watch for vowels in "stem"
2: second vowel in "stem" can't be ö
1syl+szik nope (a few exceptions only)
no ö in v2 (front labial harmony thing)

sample_nonce_stems finished, need to check otka szavak google sheet by hand

## 13-2-2022

got to sample_nonce_stems, but need to check it again. 
wrote an absolute amount of comment for files.
Readme toc up to date. text needs updating.

## 13-2-2022

stare at nonce words in google sheet, then
sample nonce words.
remember, 50 per list!
nouns: front/back, also e/é, also what kind of first vowel, maybe something with consonant cluster?
verbs: front/back,nsyl
or just do gcm already?

so it will be

stems -> words -> filter -> gcm -> sample -> forms!

do gcm on stems, but first
- change vowels in noun stems
- change consonants in ep stems (last c turns into c1 from random sample!)

## 12-2-2022

overhaul done with

stems -> words -> filter

- for nsyl==1 filtering is too strict
- initial overlap doesn't work (too well) so dropped it

next step: generating forms. some hand-filtering?

## 11-2-2022

overhaul of current to proposed design:

current design:

stems -> words -> filter (against real words, against each other) -> forms

proposed design:

stems -> filter (against real words, against each other) -> words -> forms

stems have been generated. now comes stem filtering, then form generation from filtered stems. then something!?
